Objective: To modernize the MTA's revenue structure by replacing the $2.90 flat fare with a distance-based model ($2.00 base + $0.24/mile) to improve fiscal stability and passenger equity.

Key Findings:

Revenue Surplus: The proposed model generates $3.74 Billion annually, a $277.9 Million (8%) increase over the current flat-fare system.

Commuter Relief: 29% of all trips would be cheaper under this model, providing immediate financial relief for short-distance, local commuters.

Cash Cow Identification: High-volume routes like Penn Station to 5th/53rd (E) remain the system's strongest revenue drivers, justifying tiered pricing in high-traffic corridors.
