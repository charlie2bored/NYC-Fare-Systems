## 📊 Overview

This comprehensive analysis examines whether New York City's current flat subway fare system ($2.90 per ride) should be replaced with distance-based pricing. Using 1,000,000+ origin-destination trip records from the MTA, this study evaluates equity impacts, revenue implications, and international best practices.

**Key Finding**: Distance-based fares ($2.00 + $0.24/mile) would generate **$280.5 million additional annual revenue** (+8.1%) while providing fare relief for 29% of trips.

## 🎯 Research Question

Should NYC modernize its subway fare system from a flat $2.90 fare to distance-based pricing that charges users based on service consumed?

## 📋 Quick Results

### Revenue Impact
- **Proposed Distance-Based Model**: $3.75 Billion annually
- **Current Flat Fare System**: $3.47 Billion annually  
- **Annual Revenue Increase**: $280.5 Million (+8.1%)

### Fare Impact on Riders
- **Winners (Pay Less)**: 290,758 trips (29.1%)
- **Losers (Pay More)**: 709,242 trips (70.9%)
- **Neutral (Same Fare)**: 0 trips (0.0%)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```

### Run the Analysis
```bash
python main.py
```

## 📊 Methodology

### Distance Calculation
- **Haversine Formula**: Earth radius = 3958.8 miles
- **Fare Model**: $2.00 base + $0.24 per mile
- **Annual Scaling**: Hourly ridership scaled to MTA's annual total of 1.19 billion rides

### Data Sources
- **MTA Origin-Destination Data**: 1,000,000+ subway trips
- **MTA GTFS Feeds**: Station coordinates and network data
- **International Comparisons**: Fare structures from global cities

## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. **Revenue Generation**
Distance-based pricing generates significant additional revenue for MTA improvements while maintaining system accessibility.

### 2. **Equity Considerations**
Short-distance commuters (29% of trips) receive immediate fare relief, while longer commutes contribute proportionally to system maintenance.

### 3. **Technology Ready**
NYC's OMNY contactless payment system can support distance-based fares with tap-in/tap-out functionality.

## 🛡️ Recommended Solution

**Distance-Based Fare System ($2.00 + $0.24/mile):**
- **Base Fare**: $2.00
- **Distance Rate**: $0.24 per mile
- **Equity Protections**: Maintain senior/disabled discounts and free transfers

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Fair Pricing**: Users pay for service consumed
- ✅ **Revenue Positive**: +$280.5M annually for system improvements
- ✅ **Proven Technology**: OMNY system ready for implementation
- ✅ **Global Standard**: Aligns with international best practices
